## ðŸ’¡ Problem Statement
Healthcare facilities often face challenges in effectively utilizing large-scale patient data to improve healthcare delivery and operational efficiency. Without proper analysis, hospitals cannot fully understand critical patterns such as disease trends, patient demographics, or insurance preferences, limiting their ability to improve service and allocate resources efficiently.

**The objective of this project is to analyze hospital data using Microsoft Excel to uncover key insights related to patient demographics, medical conditions, and hospital performance, providing stakeholders with actionable recommendations for improving healthcare delivery.**

## ðŸ’¡Data 
The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset) :desktop_computer: used in this project is obtained from kaggle. 

## ðŸ’¡Tools Used
* Tools : Microsoft Excel
* Keywords: Healthcare Analytics, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Pivot Table, PivotChart, VLOOKUP, Aggregate Functions, Trend Analysis, Correlation 

## ðŸ’¡Dashboard 
The dashboard analysing various metrics is presented as follows:

## ðŸ’¡Description 
The steps involved in building this healthcare analytics projects are mentioned below:
* The project begins with the process of _**data cleaning**,_ which involves removing any duplicate entries, removing null values, setting the correct format for columns with text, setting the correct datatype for each column, and so on.
* The next step is to form tables and start the analysis process, using the _**vlookup function**_ to extract useful data columns for analysis purposes.
* We created _**pivot tables**_ and _**pivot charts**_ to solve the problem statement.
* Finally, we created an interactive _**dashboard**_ to more effectively represent the analysis.
 
## ðŸ’¡Key Results
The following results were obtained after performing data analysis on the dataset:
1. _**Doctors Treating Specific Conditions**_:
A significant proportion of doctors, 16.92%, specialize in treating arthritis, while a nearly equal percentage, 16.91%, focus on managing diabetes.

2. _**Patient Blood Type Distribution**_:
Among the patients, 16.08% have a B-negative blood type, reflecting a notable segment of the patient population.

3. _**Age Demographics**_:
The majority of patients, 21.87%, are over the age of 70. This age group represents the largest portion of the patient population.

4. _**Health Condition Prevalence by Age**_:
Patients aged 70 and above experience the highest incidence of hypertension.

5. _**Patient Volume in 2020:**_
The year 2020 recorded the highest number of patients, with a total of 11,285 individuals seeking medical attention.
