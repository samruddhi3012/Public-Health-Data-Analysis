## 💡 Description 
The steps involved in building this healthcare analytics projects are mentioned below:
* The project begins with the process of data formatting and data cleaning, which involves removing any duplicate entries, removing null values, setting the correct format for columns with text, setting the correct datatype for each column, and so on.
* The next step is to form tables and start the analysis process, using the vlookup function to extract useful data columns for analysis purposes.
* In order to solve the problem statement, pivot table and pivot charts were created.
* Finally an interactive dashboard was created to represent the analysis more impactfully.
